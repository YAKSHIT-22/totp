# TOTP-Based Project

## Overview

Welcome to the TOTP-Based Project! This project demonstrates the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm, a widely used method for two-factor authentication (2FA). TOTP is an extension of the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm, which adds a time-based element to enhance security.

### What is TOTP?

TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is a method used to secure online services by generating a unique password that changes every 30 seconds. This password is generated using a shared secret key and the current time, which ensures that the code is only valid for a brief period. TOTP provides an additional layer of security beyond traditional passwords, making it a critical tool in modern authentication systems.

### How It Works

1. **Shared Secret Key**: Both the client and server share a secret key.
2. **Time-Based Code Generation**: The current timestamp is used along with the secret key to generate a one-time password (OTP) using HMAC-SHA1.
3. **Validation**: The server validates the OTP generated by the client by comparing it with the expected value for the given timestamp.

### Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Adds an extra layer of security to login processes.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated with existing authentication systems.
- **Time-Based Expiry**: Ensures that passwords are valid only for a short duration, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
